# help_pronounce

This is the repository for http://www.helppronounce.com.

I originally wrote this in 2016, intending this website to help with learning English, 
but I abandoned it after feedback that the tools like Forvo are typically most useful,
as they allow for requests and lots of different speakers.

Revived, as I suspect that it may be useful for people who would like
to separate words into phonemes.
